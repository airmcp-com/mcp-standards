## Key Test Examples

### Unit Test Example
```python
async def test_add_episode_success(self, memory_server):
    """Test adding episode with valid data"""
    result = await memory_server._add_episode(
        name="Test Episode",
        content="Test content",
        source="test"
    )

    assert result["success"] == True
    assert "id" in result
```

### Integration Test Example
```python
async def test_add_and_search_workflow(self, running_server):
    """Test complete add -> search workflow"""
    add_result = await running_server.server.call_tool(
        "add_episode",
        {"name": "Integration Test", "content": "Testing MCP"}
    )

    search_result = await running_server.server.call_tool(
        "search_episodes",
        {"query": "integration", "limit": 10}
    )

    assert search_result["count"] > 0
```

### Security Test Example
```python
async def test_path_traversal_prevention(self, memory_server):
    """Test path traversal attacks are blocked"""
    traversal_path = "/../../etc/CLAUDE.md"

    result = await memory_server._update_claudemd(traversal_path)

    assert result["success"] == False
```
