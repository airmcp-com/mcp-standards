## 🎯 Launch Day Tasks

### 1. Push to GitHub (5 min)
```bash
git push origin main --tags
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release (10 min)
- Go to: https://github.com/matt-atadata/research-mcp/releases/new
- Tag: v0.1.0
- Title: "AirMCP v0.1.0 - The AI Assistant That Learns From Your Corrections"
- Description: Copy from tag message + add:
  - Installation instructions
  - Quick start
  - Link to docs
  - Screenshots/demo (if ready)

### 3. Post on Hacker News (15 min)
**Title**: "Show HN: AirMCP – AI assistant that learns from your corrections"

**Description**:
```
Hi HN! I built AirMCP, a self-learning system for AI coding assistants.

The Problem: You keep telling Claude/Copilot the same things:
- "Use uv not pip"
- "Use uv not pip"
- "USE UV NOT PIP!!!"

The Solution: AirMCP learns after 3 corrections and auto-updates your CLAUDE.md. Never repeat yourself again.

It works by:
1. Detecting pattern in your corrections
2. Tracking frequency (3+ = promotion)
3. Updating CLAUDE.md automatically
4. Future sessions remember forever

Built with Python, SQLite + FTS5, MCP protocol. 100% local, open source (MIT).

Features:
- Self-learning pattern detection
- Config file parsing (.editorconfig, etc.)
- Production security (path whitelist, sanitization, rate limiting, audit logs)
- Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot

Demo: [link when ready]
GitHub: https://github.com/matt-atadata/research-mcp

Would love feedback from the community!
```

**Best Time**: Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10am PT

- Body: Focus on technical aspects (pattern detection, database design)

**Best Time**: Morning EST (7-9am)

### 5. Post on Twitter/X (10 min)

**Thread**:
```
🚀 Launching AirMCP - The AI assistant that learns from your corrections

Problem: You keep repeating yourself to AI

You: "Use uv not pip"
Claude: *ignores*
You: "USE UV NOT PIP"
Claude: *ignores again*
You: "I TOLD YOU 10 TIMES!!!"

[1/7]

Solution: AirMCP learns automatically

After 3 corrections → pattern detected → CLAUDE.md updated → Never repeat again

Built with Python, SQLite, MCP protocol
100% local, open source (MIT)

[2/7]

Features:
✨ Self-learning pattern detection
🎯 Auto CLAUDE.md updates
🔒 Production security
🧠 SQLite + FTS5 memory
📦 Config file parsing

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot

[3/7]

Technical details:
- Pattern extraction with regex + NLP
- Confidence scoring (3+ occurrences)
- Secure by design (whitelist, sanitization, rate limiting, audit logs)
- Fast full-text search (<50ms on 1M+ patterns)

[4/7]

Why I built this:
I was tired of repeating "use uv not pip" 50 times

Thought: What if my AI could learn like a human?

4 weeks later → AirMCP is born

[5/7]
