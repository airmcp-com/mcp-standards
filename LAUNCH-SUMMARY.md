## Marketing Copy (Ready to Use)

### Headline
"AirMCP - The AI Assistant That Learns From Your Corrections"

### Tagline
"Stop repeating yourself. AirMCP learns automatically."

### One-liner
"Learn from corrections after 3x, auto-update CLAUDE.md, never repeat again."

### Problem Statement
```
You: "Use uv not pip"
Claude: *ignores*
You: "USE UV NOT PIP"
Claude: *ignores again*
You: "I TOLD YOU 10 TIMES!!!"
```

### Solution
```
You: "Use uv not pip" (×3)
AirMCP: ✅ Pattern learned!
Claude: *uses uv forever*
```

## Competitive Positioning

| Feature | AirMCP | Tabnine | Copilot | Other MCPs |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Learns from corrections | ✅ Auto | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Updates CLAUDE.md | ✅ Auto | N/A | N/A | ❌ Manual |
| 100% local | ✅ | ❌ Cloud | ❌ Cloud | ✅ Varies |
| Open source | ✅ MIT | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Varies |

---

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- Python 3.10+
- SQLite + FTS5 (full-text search)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Pattern extraction with regex + NLP
- Confidence-based promotion (3+ occurrences)

### Security (Defense-in-Depth)
1. Path whitelist validation
2. Input sanitization (log injection prevention)
3. Rate limiting (100 patterns/min)
4. Comprehensive audit logging

### Performance
- <50ms searches on 1M+ patterns
- Minimal overhead (~5ms per pattern)
- Memory stable (LRU cache + time expiry)

## Open Source Strategy

### Why Open Core?
- **Free tier** attracts users (GitHub stars, community)
- **Paid tier** monetizes value (team features, analytics)
- **Community** contributes bug fixes, ideas
- **Portfolio** piece for future opportunities

### Pricing (If Validated)
- **Free**: Core features (forever)
- **Pro**: $49 one-time OR $9/mo (team sync, analytics)
- **Teams**: $19/user/mo (enterprise features)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Approach
1. ✅ Launch open source first (validate demand)
2. ✅ Only build paid features after validation (500+ stars)
3. ✅ Keep core free forever (no paywall drama)
4. ✅ Multiple exit scenarios (portfolio, consulting, product)

### What Could Go Wrong?
1. **No traction** (<100 stars) → Still valuable portfolio piece
2. **Some traction** (100-500 stars) → Consulting opportunities
3. **Strong traction** (500+ stars) → Launch paid tier

**Win-win scenario.**
